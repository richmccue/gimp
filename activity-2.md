# Activity 2: Basic Photo Edits

Let's move on with using GIMP and do some basic edits to a photo. If you have any questions, please ask!

1.  Download this image for the exercise: [woman in red and white shirt standing near white wall photo - Free Blonde Image](https://unsplash.com/photos/xEX_o0haX6c){:target="_blank"}

    <img src="images\act-2\1-open.png" alt="open" style="float:right;width:120px;">

2.  Open the photo in GIMP by going to **File -> Open** in the upper menu. Find where you saved the photo and open it. If your browser automatically saved it for you, it is probably in your **Downloads** folder. It may pop up with another window asking to **Convert to RGB Working Space**. (_Note: there are certain circumstances wherein you may need to convert an image to a different color profile, such as when importing from a scanner or camera. But in this case, it is not necessary._) <img src="images\act-2\2-duplicate.png" alt="duplicate" style="float:right;width:240px;">Click on **Keep**

<button onclick="toggle('gif1')"> Show / Hide Animation </buttom>
  <div id="gif1">
  <img src="images\act-2\2-open.gif" alt="open" style="width:720px;">
  </div>

<img src="images\act-2\3-littleX.png" alt="multiple tabs" style="float:right;width:240px;">

3.  We are first going to make a copy of this image before we edit it so that we keep a full size copy of our original. To do this, click on **Image** in the top menu and then click on **Duplicate**. This will create a new copy of the image. You will now see above your image that you have two tabs open in GIMP with the thumbnails of the two files. If you click on the thumbnails, a little "X" appears next to the active one and at the top of the software the filename appears. <img src="images\act-2\3-untitled.png" alt="asterisk" style="float:right;width:180px;">The new copy will be called **[Untitled]** until you save it with a new name. Make sure you are working in the one you plan to resize. It's best to close the original to avoid confusion by clicking on the little "X" next to the thumbnail

  <div id="gif2">
  <img src="images\act-2\3-duplicate.gif" alt="duplicate demo" style="width:720px;">
  </div>

4.  **Converting to Black and White:**
    -   Click on **Colors** in the top menu (see right), then **Desaturate**, and then **Desaturate...**. A small window will pop up. Make sure **Luminance** is selected as the **Mode**. Click **OK**

<button onclick="toggle('gif3')">Show / Hide Animation </buttom>
    <div id="gif3">
    <img src="images\act-2\4-desaturate.gif" alt="desaturate demo" style="width:720px;">
     </div>     
    -   Next, click on **Colors** in the top menu, then **Desaturate**, and then **Mono Mixer**. A small window will pop up. You can drag up or down each of these channels to increase or decrease each colour channel, which will impact their intensity in the image. (This can be particularly useful for photos with lots of the sky in them.) Click **OK**

<button onclick="toggle('gif4')">Show / Hide Animation </buttom>
  <div id="gif4">
  <img src="images\act-2\4-monomixer.gif" alt="monomixer" style="width:720px;">
  </div> 

    -   Click on **Colors** in the top menu again, and then click on **Curves**. This will bring up a small window. Click on the diagonal line in three places to **create three evenly spaced round handles** (see GIF animation below). Once the handles are there, you can grab them with your mouse and **drag them up or down** to make adjustments in your photo. The wave form in the back shows the lights and darks in your image. To the left of the waveform are the darks and the right side displays the lights. In the example GIF animation, the diagonal Curve line has been dragged to give an upwards bump to the brights and a downwards bump to the darks, which is a way to slightly increase the contrast of the image, if needed. Click **OK**

<button onclick="toggle('gif5')">Show / Hide Animation </buttom>
  <div id="gif5">
  <img src="images\act-2\4-colorcurves.gif" alt="color curves" style="width:720px;">
  </div>

5.  **Save:**
    -   Whenever you see the asterisk to the left of the file name up in the top center of the software, this is an indication that you've made a change to your file and have not saved it
    -   Click on **File -> Save As** in the upper left corner. We are going to save this in the GIMP .xcf format, which is the working format within GIMP. Choose where you would like to save the file and give it a name you will remember. Click **Save**

6.  **Healing Tool:** Next we will remove the visible screws in the post
    
    <img src="images\act-2\6-magnify.png" alt="magnifying glass" style="float:right;width:90px;margin-bottom:10px;">
    
    -   First, zoom in on the top screw on the post by clicking on the **Magnifying Glass** tool in the left toolbar. The options for this tool will load beneath the toolbar. Make sure **Zoom In** is selected and then click on the screw to zoom in on it

    <button onclick="toggle('gif6')">Show / Hide Animation </buttom>
      <div id="gif6">
      <img src="images\act-2\6-zoom.gif" alt="zoom demo" style="width:720px;">
      </div>    

    <img src="images\act-2\6-healing.png" alt="healing icon" style="float:right;width:80px;margin-left:10px;">

    -   Click on the **Healing Tool** in the left toolbar (bandaid icon). Beneath it, the options for this tool will load. In the options, you can choose a brush size, etc. The default of 51 should be big enough for this project

        <img src="images\act-2\6-healingmenu.png" alt="healing menu" style="float:right;width:180px;margin-bottom:10px;">

    -   Hold down the Command key (Apple) or Ctrl key (Windows) while clicking on a clean spot of the pole that you want to duplicate and use to replace in the area where the screw is. Release the button and the mouse and then use your left mouse button to **draw over the screw** until it is gone. Go ahead and clean up the blemish right above it too. See to the right for a before and after. Optionally, use the **Healing Tool** to remove the screw at the base of the pole
    <button onclick="toggle('gif7')">Show / Hide Animation </buttom>
      <div id="gif7">
      <img src="images\act-2\6-healing.gif" alt="healing demo" style="width:720px;">
    
      </div>

    <img src="images\act-2\6-somemore.png" alt="some more" style="float:right;width:180px;height:240px;margin-left:10px;">
    <img src="images\act-2\6-screw.png" alt="screw" style="float:right;width:180px;height:240px;margin-left:10px;">

    -   Use the **Zoom Tool** to zoom back out to see the whole photo
    -   Click on **File -> Save** to save your recent changes
7.  **Exporting:**
    -   To export this to a full size JPG file, click on **File -> Export As** in the upper left corner. A window will pop up with options. Change the **File Type** to **JPG** in the dropdown in the lower left corner of the **Export Image** window. Choose your save location. Click the **Export** button in the bottom corner when ready. Another small window will pop up giving you some additional options. Change the quality to 100. Click **Export**
    -   You will now have your original unedited photo, an edited .xcf working format that you can go back and edit more, and a JPG file that is ready to print. If you want a smaller JPG to share online, you can scale down the pixels using the instructions from Activity #1
